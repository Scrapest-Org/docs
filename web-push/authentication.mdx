Most endpoints in the Web Push Service are protected and require authentication.

## API Token

To authenticate your requests, you must include the `x-api-token` header with your configured secret key.

<ParamField header="x-api-token" type="string" required>
  The secret API key configured in your `WEBPUSH_KEY` environment variable.
</ParamField>

## Live Demo

You can interact with our live Web Push instance at:

`https://webpush-production.up.railway.app/`

<Note>
  Authentication is required for all state-changing operations and sensitive
  data access on the live instance.
</Note>

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://webpush-production.up.railway.app/track-user \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-token: YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN" \
  -d '{ "username": "elonmusk" }'
```
