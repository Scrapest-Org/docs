## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)**: The JavaScript runtime used by the service.
- **Redis**: Required for storing webhook URLs.

## Installation

Navigate to the `apps/web_push` directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd apps/web_push
bun install
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `apps/web_push` directory (or use the root `.env` if configured) with the following variable:

```env
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"
PORT=6969
```

### Twitter Configuration

copy `config_example.json` to `config.json` and update it with your Twitter credentials:

```json
{
  "twitter": {
    "screen_name": "YOUR_SCREEN_NAME",
    "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
    "authentication_secret": "YOUR_2FA_SECRET",
    "retry": 5,
    "cookies": { "auth_token": "", "ct0": "" }
  }
  // ... other fields are auto-generated
}
```

<Warning>
  If `twitter.retry` hits 0, the script stops. Check your credentials and reset
  it to 5.
</Warning>

## Running the Service

### Development

To run with hot-reloading enabled:

```bash
bun run dev
```

### Production

To run in production mode:

```bash
bun run start
```

The server will start on port `6969` (or your configured `PORT`).
