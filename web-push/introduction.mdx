The **Web Push Service** allows you to track Twitter/X users and receive their updates via push notifications, which are then forwarded to registered verification webhooks.

## Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Receive tweets as soon as they are pushed by Twitter.
- **Webhook Integration**: Forward notifications to your own endpoints.
- **Twitter Authentication**: Handles login and session management automatically.
- **Mozilla Autopush**: Utilizes the robust Autopush service for reliable delivery.

## How it Works

The service operates by:

1.  **Logging into Twitter**: Using provided credentials or cookies.
2.  **Registering with Autopush**: Establishing a connection to Mozilla's push service.
3.  **Linking Account**: Associating the push endpoint with your Twitter account.
4.  **Listening**: Waiting for push notifications via WebSocket.
5.  **Forwarding**: Decrypting the payload and sending it to your registered webhooks.

<Note>
  Using this program may result in the suspension of your Twitter account. Use
  at your own risk.
