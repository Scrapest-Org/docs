description: "Start tracking Twitter/X users with the Web Push API"
---

The **Web Push API** enables you to programmatically track Twitter (X) users and receive their tweets in real-time via webhooks.

Instead of polling Twitter's API or scraping pages, this service pushes new tweets to your server the moment they are posted.

## What can you do?

- **Track Users**: Add specific Twitter users to your tracking list.
- **Receive Webhooks**: Get JSON payloads sent to your URL whenever a tracked user tweets.
- **Manage Subscriptions**: Add or remove users from your tracking list dynamically via API.

## Getting Started

To start receiving updates, you only need to:

1.  **Authentication**: Get your API key ready.
2.  **Register a Webhook**: Tell us where to send the data.
3.  **Track a User**: Tell us who to watch.

Check out the [API Reference](/web-push/api-reference/health) to see the available endpoints.
