The **Web Push Service** is a specialized tool designed to track Twitter/X users and receive real-time updates via push notifications. It bridges the gap between Twitter's internal push notification system and your own applications by forwarding these notifications to registered webhooks.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Tweet Updates**: Capture tweets instantly as they are pushed by Twitter's infrastructure.
- **Webhook Integration**: Seamlessly forward notifications to your own http endpoints for processing.
- **Automated Authentication**: Handles Twitter login, session management, and guest token generation automatically.
- **Mozilla Autopush**: Leverages Mozilla's reliable Autopush service to maintain a persistent connection with Twitter.

## How it Works

The service orchestrates several components to deliver notifications:

1.  **Authentication**: Logs into Twitter using provided credentials and cookies.
2.  **Push Registration**: Registers with Mozilla Autopush to obtain a unique push endpoint.
3.  **Account Linking**: Associates the push endpoint with your Twitter account to enable notifications.
4.  **WebSocket Listener**: Maintains a persistent WebSocket connection to receive incoming push payloads.
5.  **Payload Decryption & Forwarding**: Decrypts the push notification payload and forwards the relevant tweet data to your configured webhooks.

<Warning>
  **Risk Warning**: This tool automates interactions with Twitter/X in ways that
  may be against their Terms of Service. Using this program could result in the
  suspension or banning of your Twitter account. Use at your own risk.
